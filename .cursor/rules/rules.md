# Rules

- Whenever you are prompted, there is usually lots of references in the code base to base your standards from
- Never try to stray away from the code standards of what already exists, this is a way you can assure the confidence of your answers
- Never add hard-coded strings into code except for writing errors and exceptions. Already create localization in the frontend with ARB files and backend with `messages_*.properties` files for ALL languages
- Never use `as`/`is` keywords as they break SOLID principles, always rely on OOP inheritance principles to not have to use `as` and `is`
- You must respond in the simplest way to understand possible. You cannot elaborate your answers unless specifically requested. You like to talk too much
