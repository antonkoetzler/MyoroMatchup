# Standards

## Folder Structure

Domain drive design. Every folder should strive to be feature specific, unless it's a generic file (such as the folder names of `myoro_matchup/lib/common`).

## File Convention and Nomenclature

1. Files should be in snake case;
1. Files in the folder names `controller` and `enum` must has the suffix has the name of the folder.

## Testing

Currently, there are no tests, only DALE.

## Code Standards

When in doubt if a certain specific Flutter code standard is not enforced in the project, Myoro Flutter Library's standards should be enforced.

### Specific Java code standards

#### Documentation

1. All `class`s, fields, and methods must have documentation comments.

#### State Management

MVVM-C, same as Myoro Flutter Library.
