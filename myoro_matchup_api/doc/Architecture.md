# Architecture

Explaining each piece of `myoro_matchup_api`.

## JWT Tokens

JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization, generated by JwtService and validated by JwtAuthenticationFilterComponent.

## Localization (`myoro_matchup_api/src/main/resources/*.properties`)

Besides Swagger documentation, all text must be localized.

## Project root folders (`myoro_matchup_api/src/main/java/com/myoro/myoro_matchup_api`)

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/component`

Contains Spring components that handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication filters and entry points - create files here when you need reusable components that don't fit into other layers.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/config`

Contains Spring configuration classes for beans, security, and application setup - create files here when you need to configure Spring framework features or define application-wide settings.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/controller`

Contains REST controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses - create files here when you need to expose new API endpoints or handle web requests.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/dto`

Contains Data Transfer Objects for API requests and responses - create files here when you need to define the structure of data being sent to or received from the API.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/exception`

Contains custom exception classes and global exception handlers - create files here when you need to define custom error handling or specific exception types.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/model`

Contains JPA entity classes that represent database tables - create files here when you need to add new database entities or modify existing data models.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/repository`

Contains Spring Data JPA repository interfaces for database operations - create files here when you need to add new database query methods or data access patterns.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/service`

Contains business logic service classes that handle application functionality - create files here when you need to implement business rules, data processing, or coordinate between different layers.

### `<PROJECT ROOT>/util`

Contains utility classes with static helper methods and constants - create files here when you need shared helper functions, validation rules, or application-wide constants.
